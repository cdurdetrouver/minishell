# Minishell

## Description
Minishell is a project carried out as part of the curriculum at Ecole 42. The goal is to create a command-line interpreter (shell) in the C language capable of understanding and executing certain basic commands.

## Features
- **Interactive Prompt:** Minishell displays an interactive prompt where the user can enter commands.
- **Built-in Commands:** The shell supports built-in commands such as `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.
- **Execve Commands:** with the function
  ```c
  int execve(const char *pathname, char *const _Nullable argv[], char *const _Nullable envp[]);
  ```
   you can execute like any of the function that have a program in your computer located in your environment path.
- **Error Handling:** Minishell handles user errors informatively.
- **Redirections:** The shell supports standard input/output redirection (`>`, `<`, `>>`).
- **Pipes:** Minishell allows the use of pipes for command chaining.
- **History of Command:** Minishell maintains a command history, allowing users to navigate and rerun previous commands.
- **Environment Variable:** The shell supports environment variables, allowing users to set and use variables in their commands.
- **Signal Handling:** Minishell implements signal handling to manage signals like Ctrl+C gracefully.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile the project, use the `make` command:
```bash
make
```
To run the shell, use the following command:
```bash
./minishell
```
## Usage Examples
1. **Execution of Built-in Commands:**
   ```bash
   游릭 cdurdetrouver@minishell: ../minishell$ echo "Hello, Minishell!"
   Hello, Minishell!
   游릭 cdurdetrouver@minishell: ../minishell$
   ```
2. **Using Redirections:**
   ```bash
   游릭 cdurdetrouver@minishell: ../minishell$ cat file.txt > new_file.txt
   游릭 cdurdetrouver@minishell: ../minishell$
   ```
3. **Using Pipes:**
   ```bash
   游릭 cdurdetrouver@minishell: ../minishell$ cat file.txt | grep "pattern"
   pattern 1: test
   pattern 2: test2
   游릭 cdurdetrouver@minishell: ../minishell$
   ```
